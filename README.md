# Light Gun Framework (alpha)

**THIS IS THE CORE FRAMEWORK**

> **Note:** This repository contains the core code of the Light Gun framework. For setting up a new project, see the project template repository [`light-gun/light-gun`](https://github.com/light-gun/light-gun).

## Project Vision

Provide a lightweight toolset for building event-driven web services.

Light Gun leverages React PHP for its event loop. It leverages the Lumen microframework for lightweight routing, middleware, and application structure.

Ideally, it would be nice to provide some additional wrappers for consistent, easy-to-use asynchronous interfaces.
